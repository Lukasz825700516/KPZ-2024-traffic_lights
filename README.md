# KPZ 2024: intelligent traffic lights

This repository contains project for the [kpz.pwr.edu.pl 2024](https://kpz.pwr.edu.pl/) during which 
our team was tasked with creating an intelligent traffic lights system for pedestrians.

# Repository contents

Besides holding the code behind the traffic lights system, the repository will also contain records or 
benchmarks and other tests that were made along the way for the purpose of guidance in the later project
stages which will require fine tuning of used AI model.

Under the `report/` directory, there will be files used for generation of the report for the university course
of what we have accomplished. All reports for given stage of the project will also be available under the 
releases section of the github page.
